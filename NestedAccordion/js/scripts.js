// For every word that is the color blue,
// make it clickable and drop down
// to reveal more detailed descriptions of the blue words.

// The arrows are light gray unless you hover over it with the mouse.
// Then they become blue.

// We will need DOM along with JavaScript to do this.

// Tag script source to scripts.js to link the JavaScript and the HTML.
// This will connect the two so that the website can come alive!

// We have to remember to have the .js file and the .html file in the same
// big folder, for this example the NestedAccordion.

// We need to connect our JavaScript to the class name that controls the blue words.

// Maybe we need to "push" and "pop" the paragraph like we would with an array.

// We want an onclick event handler to drop down the descriptions, which is a DOM property?

//CHANGE!

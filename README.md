## Block Statements
Block statements are what the squiggles are.
Anything within the squiggles is part of the block statement.
if, else statements always use block statements in addition to parenthesis.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional satements only work if what's inside the condition ends up being true.
If, else statements are also conditional statements.

## Switch Statements

Switch statements start with the word switch and then look something like this...

switch (SportsTeam) {
  case Panthers:
    console.log("Panthers are the best!");
    break;
  case DukeBB:
    console.log("DukeBB is the best!");
    break;
    ...
  default:
    console.log("I don't know that team. They must suck.");
    break;
}

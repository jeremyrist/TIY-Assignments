# Basic Literal Types ===


1. **null**
2. **Boolean** (true or false)
3. **Number**
4. **String**

**null**: is used as a place holder for when you want nothing to be represented

**Booleans**: return either true or false

**Numbers**: are numbers but only integers and rational numbers

**Strings**: are words that are bookended with quotation marks, either one or two


# Basic Operators ===


**Arithmetic** can be used in javascript just like in normal math classes. Addition is addition and subtraction is subtraction. Everything works exactly the same when dealing with numbers but when dealing with Booleans or strings things get more complicated. 

**Comparisons** do what you would expect comparisons to do. Their output is based off of whether or not the equation is true or false. 

**Assignments** are used to stick the right to the left. This is most commonly used with equals signs. 

# Built-in Constants ===


**undefined** is what happens when a variable does not have a value.

**NaN** stands for **"Not-A-Number"** and is returned when a math problem involves something that is not numbers.

**Infinity** is the same as infinity in math.

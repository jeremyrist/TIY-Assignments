## `<html>`

the main enchilada, the whole `document`, that which wraps all the others... except for [`<!DOCTYPE>`](#doctype), for some reason.

* _parents_: none, it's the top
* _content_: _only_ [`<head>`](#head) and [`<body>`](#body)
* _display_: `block`, maybe? I mean, I can see it... RESEARCH!

### Attributes

* `class` -- a space-separated list of category names
* . . .

. . .

## `<div>`

A generic page division that should only be used if no other, more semantic choice is appropriate... and because @al-the-x might kill me if I do when I could use [`<section>`](#section) instead.

* _parents_: anything that accepts [Flow Content][1], which is apparently a lot of things.
* _content_: any [Flow Contant][1], palpable content (WTF?)
* _display_: `block`

. . .
